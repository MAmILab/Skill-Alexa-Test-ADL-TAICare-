Alexa Skill for personalized and abbreviated ADL Scale

**A new scale has been designed to assess the independence of older people. This scale is based on the Barthel (BADL) and Lawton & Brody (IADL) indices.**

After analysing all the most common scales, the most recent ones opt for the use of Likert scales to carry out the questionnaire.

In addition, an analysis of the types of Likert scales has been carried out to determine the best option for our questionnaire. From this analysis, we conclude that a 5-option Likert scale is ideal. However, if we are talking about events prior to the administration of the scale, it is better to remove the neutral option. Therefore, we have opted for a 4-option Likert scale, as we are asking about situations that have already occurred.

## Our abbreviated and dynamic scale for assessing independence

- 6 items
- Shopping
- Meal Preparation
- Score < 3
        - Stairs
        - Walking
        - Continence
        - Bathing
- Score ≥ 3
        - Laundry
        - Housekeeping
        - Medication use
        - Entertainment
        - Hierarchical
- Likert scale with 4 response options rated from 0 to 2
- Maximum score 12 (independent)
- 12-9 (sufficient independence), 8-5 (moderate dependence), 4-0 (dependent)

The proposed scale is based on the article: **How many and which items of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are necessary for screening.** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.critrevonc.2006.10.001

In the words of the article itself:

    *"…“shopping” and “meal preparation”. If the patient needs help in at least one of these two items, it can be automatically concluded that he has limitations, and the decision to perform a complete rather than an abbreviated assessment can be made at this early stage. If the patient does not need any help within these two questions, the four selected items of the ADL should be determined in the order “ascend and descend stairs”, “urine and bowel continence”, “walking on a corridor” and “taking a bath or a shower”. With these six selected items, 98.5% of the patients with limitations in ADL or IADL can be recognised."*
